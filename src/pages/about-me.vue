              I have always been awkward with introductions and it does help
              that I do not like introducing myself either. This may be why I
              focus more on skills, abilities and knowledge of myself and others
              to get to know them better, but for you, and for this blog, I
              think i'll keep it short.

              I love the process of creation, I like going in steps, I like
              going forwards with rules, and I like worlds that I can see myself
              in. This lead me to trying to learn more about the world as we
              know it, and it lead me to focusing more on the tangible elements
              of Worldbuilding and the more realistic aspects that could be
              grasped. The blogs first purpose is to express the ideas I have,
              and the knowledge I have gained from the time I spent reading,
              researching, creating, and assessing, but it seems to me that I
              have trouble getting my thoughts across, so I hope you can bare
              along with me.

          Although what I love to do is inherently artistic, programming always
          felt natural to me. I was always a geek, still am, but I loved the
          process of solving the bugs, and creating a finished product. Maybe
          this is also in line with what I like to do in worldbuilding?
