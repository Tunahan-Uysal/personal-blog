## What is the Cathar Religion?

The Cathar Religion is a dualistic religious belief system that originated in the Languedoc region of Southern France in the early 11th century. It was known for its emphasis on personal salvation through asceticism and good deeds, rather than through the intercession of the Catholic Church. Cathars believed in a war between Good and Evil, with the Good God creating the Universe and the Evil God creating the material world. The Cathar Religion was considered heretical by the Catholic Church and was suppressed in the Albigensian Crusade.

## The Unknown Sects

Despite its widespread influence, the Cathar Religion has several unknown sects that are not widely documented. These sects were often isolated from the mainstream Cathar religion and were known for their unique rituals and beliefs. Some of these sects include:

- The Bogomils: Known for their radical dualism and anti-clerical stance, the Bogomils were one of the most radical sects of the Cathars.

- The Paulicians: Another radical sect, the Paulicians were known for their belief in the complete separation of the soul from the body.

- The Patarens: The Patarens were a sect that believed in the absolute predestination of the soul, and they are known for their millenarian beliefs.
